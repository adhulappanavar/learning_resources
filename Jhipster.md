## Microservices with Istio, JHipster and Kubernetes

Microservices with Istio, JHipster and Kubernetes
Istio service-mesh is the coolest kid in the block. Istio helps with service discovery, load balancing, circuit breaking, monitoring and much more. But setting it up could be a daunting task for beginners and pros alike, this is where JHipster steps in and makes everything a cakewalk. JHipster is a widely-used OSS application development platform for creating web applications and microservices in minutes You will learn how to create a production-grade microservice architecture with Spring Boot, Istio, Netflix OSS, Docker, Kubernetes & JHipster and deploy it to cloud under 30 minutes.
